                <h1>General terms and conditions – TimoCom CashCare seal</h1>
<br />
<h2>Section 1 General / conclusion of contract</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The following terms and conditions apply exclusively to all services arising from this contractual relationship. Terms and conditions of the customer are non-binding even in cases where TIMOCOM does not expressly contradict them. Additional agreements are only valid if made in writing.</li>
    <li>In addition to this, any licensing conditions from the manufacturer that may be enclosed with the products shall apply. All product names and logos are the property of the respective manufacturers to which they belong. Product illustrations are intended as examples and may deviate from the products supplied.</li>
    <li>Our details and quotations in respect of the goods sold and related product descriptions are non-binding and may be subject to standard trade variations. In respect of the continuous further development and improvement of products, we reserve the right to make changes to versions that may contrast with those in our printed catalogues and the details provided in our online shop system, to the extent that such changes remain within the bounds of customer acceptability. The aforementioned also applies to amendments that serve the purposes of ongoing delivery capability. The company reserves the right to make printing errors and mistakes.</li>
    <li>Any transfer of rights and obligations from the purchase contract require the written consent of TIMOCOM. Deviations from these business terms and conditions, supplementary agreements and sub-agreements must always be made in writing.</li>
    <li>Purchase contracts only enter into force on receipt of an order confirmation from TIMOCOM (e-mail is satisfactory) or the acceptance of goods by the customer (and for consumers following the expiry of their cancellation / return-of-goods period).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 2 Prices and payment terms and conditions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>For deliveries, the prices at the time goods are ordered are the ones that shall apply. For deliveries resulting from call-out contracts, the time of shipping each consignment of goods is the decisive factor. This does not affect the consumer's legal right of cancellation or return of goods. The prices are inclusive of shipping costs. In the area designated for contractors and corporate clients, net prices are shown exclusive of sales tax (VAT) at the applicable rate.</li>
    <li>Payment is made by direct debit, payment in advance or interbank transfer.</li>
    <li>Bank drafts or cheques are only accepted after prior agreement and on account of payment. Bank discount fees and collection charges are billed to the customer. TIMOCOM accepts no liability in respect of timely presentation.</li>
    <li>Customers are only entitled to rights of retention if their counter-claim is based on the same contractual relationship. There is no entitlement to charge the customer unless the customer's counter-claims are legitimately founded or are not disputed by TIMOCOM.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 3 Delivery to ourselves, delivery lead times</h2>
<ol>
    <li>All quotations and, where applicable, agreed delivery lead times are subject to goods having first been delivered to ourselves correctly and on time. TIMOCOM does not accept any procurement risk and is entitled to withdraw from the contract if despite the prior conclusion of a purchase contract, TIMOCOM has not received its own delivery of goods. For business transactions with consumers, this proviso of prior receipt of goods depends upon TIMOCOM itself being unable to cover customer orders for specific goods from its own resources. This does not affect the responsibility of TIMOCOM is respect of deliberate intent and negligent action. TIMOCOM shall inform the customer immediately of any delay in the availability of a delivery item and if TIMOCOM then wishes to withdraw, it shall exercise its right of retraction with immediate effect; in the event of TIMOCOM opting to retract, the customer shall be refunded immediately to the appropriate amount.</li>
    <li>If failure to comply is the result of force majeure, examples of which are itemized in Section 7 a Para. 3 Clause 2 GüKG, the deadlines shall be extended accordingly. The same applies if that delay is the result of a customer failing to provide and/or communicate all information required for a delivery. In cases a delay in service delivery resulting from deliberate intent or negligent action, TIMOCOM shall be liable in accordance with legislative requirements. In other cases where the service delivery is delayed, the liability of TIMOCOM for compensation shall be restricted to 5% plus the service and to 10% in respect of compensation without the service, said percentages being in respect of the product and/or service affected. The customer shall not be entitled to claims that extend beyond this in scope - even after the expiry of any service delivery deadline that may be set by TIMOCOM.</li>
    <li>To the extent that a delivery proves to be impossible, the customer is entitled to demand compensation in accordance with legislative requirements. However, the entitlement of a customer to compensation along with or instead of the service in respect of the reimbursement of expenditure incurred unnecessarily, shall be restricted to 10% of the value of the part of a service or product that cannot be used in the intended manner as a consequence of this 'impossible' factor. The customer shall not be entitled to make further claims on the basis of a product or service being impossible to deliver. This does not affect the legal right of the customer to withdraw from this contract.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 4 Partial delivery, shipment</h2>
<ol>
    <li>TIMOCOM is entitled to make partial deliveries provided that it is reasonable to expect the customer to accept these, and provided that nothing to the contrary has been agreed.</li>
    <li>The customer is obliged to check each shipment on receipt to ensure that it bears no external signs of damage. If the customer discovers the presence of externally visible damage in transit, the customer is obliged to obtain confirmation from the delivery company. Whenever damage in transit is detected, the package must be taken straight to the post office and/or to the transport company involved and due confirmation of the damage must be obtained. At this point, the package is out of circulation and must be returned to TIMOCOM together with the confirmation from post office or the transport company. The customer shall then receive a replacement delivery. Whenever damage in transit becomes apparent after unpacking a shipment of goods, the customer must report this fact to TIMOCOM without delay. The warranty rights also remain unaffected by this paragraph.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 5 Shipment and dispatch costs</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The delivery takes place within Germany and to customers in other member states of the European Union. Other countries on request.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to choose the transport company.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 6 Reservation of title</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Ownership of the purchased item is not transferred until all receivables arising from the contract have been settled in full.</li>
    <li>In the event of distraint or liens being applied by third parties, or any other form of intervention on the purchased item, the customer is required to notify TIMOCOM immediately and in writing.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 7 Non-acceptance of ordered goods by a sub-contractor</h2>
<br />
<p>In the event of a contractor who is a customer withdrawing from the contract without just cause or failing to meet his obligation to accept incoming goods, TIMOCOM is entitled to demand compensation on the grounds of non-compliance. In this case, TIMOCOM is entitled to demand 15% of the net purchase price by way of compensation without this curtailing its ability to claim a higher level of compensation to reflect actual losses, and there is no need in the first instance to provide substantiating evidence of damage caused. This does not apply if the customer is able to verify that actual damages incurred were less than this in financial value. Once goods have been delivered, TIMOCOM can impose the sanction of the aforementioned non-compliance damages plus the cost of two-way transport.</p>
<br />
<h2>Section 8 Warranty, disclaimer and/or restriction</h2>
<ol>
    <li>If the customer is a consumer, warranty claims from that customer are restricted initially to the customer's choice of rectification of defects or a delivery of replacement goods, whereby TIMOCOM is entitled to reject the customer's choice if it entails a disproportionate level of cost. In cases where the customer is a contractor, the aforementioned elective right, i.e. choice, does not apply. Here, in the first instance, TIMOCOM has a choice between rectification of defects or replacement delivery.</li>
    <li>In the event of the rectification of defects or replacement delivery failing, the customer is entitled to reduce the level of remuneration or to withdraw from the contract. None of this affects legal entitlements to claims for compensation. Any rectification of defects is deemed to have failed if the second attempt is also unsuccessful. In the event of remedial action failing or if the vendor refuses to carry out remedial action, the customer is free to choose between reducing the purchase price, withdrawing from the contract or demanding compensation. The right of the customer to apply further compensation claims above and beyond the terms and conditions defined below shall not be affected.</li>
    <li>Restrictions or exemptions on warranty in this contract relating to damages incurred by the customer shall not apply in cases of:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>deliberate intent or gross negligence on the part of TIMOCOM;</li>
            <li>culpable violation of a significant contractual obligation that jeopardises fulfilment of contractual purpose;</li>
            <li>liability resulting from fraudulent intent or the granting of a guarantee;</li>
            <li>liability in accordance with compelling legislation, for example the law governing product liability;</li>
            <li>liability for culpable injury to life, limb or health </li>
        </ol>
    on the part of TimoCom, its legal representatives or agents.</li>
    <li>If the customer is a contractor, liability is limited in the cases described in the preceding paragraph 3 lit. a) and b) to gross negligence in relation to typical forms of damage that could be anticipated at the time the contract was being concluded.</li>
    <li>Deliveries by companies of greater or lesser amounts than stipulated in the order for goods being manufactured and/or supplied that do not exceed 10% arise as a consequence of technical factors and do not constitute grounds for a complaint by the contractor. For consumers, there is no limitation on their legal right to make claims.</li>
    <li>Restrictions or exemptions on liability in this contract do not apply to injury to life, limb and health that result from a culpable violation of obligations on the part of TIMOCOM, its legal representatives or its agents, nor to liability as defined in product liability legislation. TIMOCOM is liable to an unlimited extent for damages of this nature. The same applies to damages resulting from deliberate or grossly negligent contractual violations or fraudulent intent on the part of TIMOCOM and/or its legal representatives or its agents.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 9 Note about obligations of the customer in the presence of defects, warranty periods</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Note and rules for consumers as defined in Section 13 of the German Civil Code (BGB) (including those contractors who submit an order that does not constitute part of their commercial or autonomous vocational activity). The warranty period for used items extends to 1 year and commences on the date of transfer of title. For new goods, the legally defined warranty period covers two years from transfer of title of goods to customers.</li>
    <li>Note and rules for contractors - a prerequisite for effective application of warranty claims by the contractor must be that the contractor complies properly with the obligation to investigate the matter and to complain about defects immediately in accordance with Section 377 of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The customer is obliged to examine the goods immediately after receipt and, if a defect is discovered, to notify TIMOCOM of this with immediate effect. It is sufficient to submit a defect report in a timely fashion. The period of limitation for the reporting of defects in new goods is 1 year commencing with the date of receipt of said goods. No warranty cover is provided in respect of second-hand goods.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 10 Copyright over print designs</h2>
<ol>
    <li>When the customer hands over a design, texts or logos etc. as a motif for printing on goods ordered from ourselves, the customer is obliged to ensure that the design is unencumbered by third party rights of any kind (copyright, brand and name-related legislation etc.). The customer is liable for all infringements of this nature to the rights of third parties and shall hold TIMOCOM harmless from such claims unless action on the part of TIMOCOM renders it co-liable. In such eventualities, each party is liable for settling a commensurate share of any damages incurred, i.e. each shall be liable to pay a proportional amount towards the figure involved.</li>
    <li>The customer undertakes to notify TIMOCOM immediately of any third party claims to which it may become exposed and where said claims are founded wholly or in part on the products purchased and/or processed by TIMOCOM.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 11 Data protection</h2>
<ol>
    <li>TIMOCOM draws the attention of the customer to the fact that data relating to the customer shall be recorded and archived during the process of concluding this contract. This data can also be communicated to authorised and carefully selected partners of TIMOCOM for credit checking purposes and in accordance with Section 11 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). All personal details shall be treated confidentially.</li>
    <li>By placing orders, customers indicate their willingness to have their details stored. Customers are entitled at any time to view the details kept on file about them and, where necessary, to amend and/or delete those details. If any party placing an order (i.e. the customer) refuses to have personal details stored in this way, the order shall be voided.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Section 12 Court of jurisdiction / applicable law</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Only German Law shall apply, and application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods is excluded (UN CISG).</li>
    <li>In cases where the customer is a merchant/trader or a legal entity in civil law, court of jurisdiction is local to the head office location of TIMOCOM for all disputes arising from contractual matters. TIMOCOM is however entitled to bring charges against the customer at the court of jurisdiction local to the head office location of that customer.</li>
